### Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**1.Overview of the project**

The purpose of this project is to  determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program within Pewlett-Hackard ("PH"). This report will detail the number of employees and their company wide demographics that are eligible for retirement, or of a projected retirement age (born between the years of 1952 and 1955).

The above count table notes the amount of retirement eligible employees of Pewlett-Hackard. Currently there are 90,398 retirement eligible employees.
    
    2.b specific job functions of the Silver Tsunami
    
The table notes a positional preference of retirement eligible individuals towards middle management, and should be addressed by proper headcount. As noted in the table, retirement eligible individuals currently fill a majority of Senior level positions, followed by individual contributor positions, and less so management and assistant roles.

The number of mentorship-eligible individuals currently is at 1549 total. These individuals are qualified through their age, born in the year 1965.  

    2.d The mentorship eligible individuals also are in a wide range of job titles to take on mentees

**3. Summary**

Through the table analysis, we can see that PH will have middle to senior management headcount issues down the road. The current retirement eligible population totals 90,398 individuals within PH. There is a small population within PH that are mentorship eligible, in the sense that they are senior enough in age to act as mentors, but further analysis will be needed to determine if this population has been with PH long enough to provide substantial mentorship guidance to new hires.
